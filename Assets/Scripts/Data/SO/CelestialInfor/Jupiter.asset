      STAR-LIKE

      Jupiter is the planet most like the
      Sun in terms of its compostion . Although Jupiter would still need to be about
      75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and be com a star. it would only need
      to be 13 times as massive to burn deuterium and become a brown dwarf.


      ATMOSPHERE

      Jupiter
      spins on its axis faster than any other planets. Because of this rotation,
      Jupiter''s asmosphere is subject to high winds, which cause the atmosphere
      to form distinct bands of colour, like swirling vortices and gigantic anticyclonic
      storms.


      MOON

      Jupiter governs the largest number of moons of
      any planet, with the current official total being 79. The four largest are
      the Galliean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest
      moon in the Solar System, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.


      OBSERVATION

      Jupiter 
      is the fourth brightest object in our skies affter the Sun, Moon, and Venus.
      Becase the orbit of Jupiter is outside the Earth''s the planet always appears
