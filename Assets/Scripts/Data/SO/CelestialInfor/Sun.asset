    longInfo: "The Sun, also referred to as \"Sol\", is the star at the center of
      the Solar System. Sun's mass accounts for some 99.86% of the total mass of
      the Solar System.\n\nCOMPOSITION\nRoughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass
      is hydrogen, with the rest mostly helium. Only 1.69% of the Sun (which is still
      5 628 times the mass of the Earth) is made up of heavier elements like carbon,
      iron, neon and oxygen.\n\nDISTANCE\nThe mean distance of the Sun from the Earth
      is approximately 149.6 million kilometres (1 AU). On average, it takes light
      from the Sun about 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach the Earth.\n\nGALAXY\nOnce
      thought to be a relatively insignificant star, the Sun is now considered to
      be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. It is located
      about two thirds of the way out from the centre of the Milky Way.\r"
