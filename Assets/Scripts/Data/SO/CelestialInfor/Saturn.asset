      MASS

      Although the second largest,
      Saturn is the least dese of all the planets in the Solar System, with only
      one-eighth the density of Earth(but nine times its diameter). It is also the
      only planet is less dese than water.


      RING

      While the other gas
      giants also have ring systems, Saturn''s is larger and more visible than any 
      other in the Solar System. The rings are composed of water ice crystals and
      a smaller amount of rock, ragingg in size fromm specks of dust to a few praticles
      as large as mountains.


      OBSERVATION

      Saturn appears to the naked
      eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. Magnifying at least
