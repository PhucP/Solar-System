    description: 'Our homeworld is the densest of the eight planet in the Solar System.
      It is also the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\nSURFACE\nAbout 71%
      of the Earth is covered by salt water oceans, and the remaining 30% is taken
      up by the seven continential landmasses. Earth''s outer surface is also devided
      into several rigid segment, or tectonic plates, that migrate across the surface
      over periods of millions of years.\nAXIAL TILT\nToday, the Earth is titlted
      on its axis by 23.4 degree, producing seasonal variations in climate and weather
      across the surface of the planet during the course of a year./nMAG.FIELD\nThe
      Earth''s magnetic field is generated within th molten outer core region of
      the planet and extends outwards to from the magnetosphere: a barrier surrounding
      the Earth, deflecting particles of the solar wind and protecting the Earth
      from Sun''s radiation.'
