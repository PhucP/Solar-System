      DISCOVERY

      was the first to be discovered by the use of the modern telescope, with its
      discovery credited to the English astronomer William Herschel in 1781.


      AXIAL
      TILT

      Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77 degree, meaning is effectively
      rolls around the Sun "on its side" compared to the other planets in the Solar
      System.


      OBSERVATION

      While in Opposition(from the Sun, relative
      to the Earth), Uranus becomes visible to the naked-eye. It would appear as
      a faint star under dark sky condition.'
