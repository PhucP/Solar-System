    description: 'Jupiter is the largest planet of the Solar System, with a mass
      2.5 greater than all of the rest of the planets combined - but still only one-thousandth
      that of the Sun.\n\nSTAR-LIKE\nJupiter is the planet most like the Sun in terms
      of its compostion . Although Jupiter would still need to be about 75 times
      as massive to fuse hydrogen and be com a star. it would only need to be 13
      times as massive to burn deuterium and become a brown dwarf.\n\nATMOSPHERE
      Jupiter spins on its axis faster than any other planets. Because of this rotation,
      Jupiter''s asmosphere is subject to high winds, which cause the atmosphere
      to form distinct bands of colour, like swirling vortices and gigantic anticyclonic
      storms.\n\nMOON\nJupiter governs the largest number of moons of any planet,
      with the current official total being 79. The four largest are the Galliean
      moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest moon in the
      Solar System, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.\n\nOBSERVATION\nJupiter 
      is the fourth brightest object in our skies affter the Sun, Moon, and Venus.
      Becase the orbit of Jupiter is outside the Earth''s the planet always appears
      nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes.'
