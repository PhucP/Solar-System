    description: 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest
      planet in the Solar System. The reddish appearance of Mars''s surface is caused
      by iron oxide(rust).


      EARTH-LIKE

      While the Mars is abour half
      as big as the Earth, there ara still many similarities: Mars has a rocky surface
      and polar ice caps, the day on Mars are only 40 minutes longer, the axial tilt
      give it similar seasons to ours(although each last about twice as long).


      SURFACE

      Mars
      has a dramatic landscape, with towering valcanoes and a great vanyon system.
      Of all the planets in the Solar System. It has the highest mountain, Olympus
      Mons, and the largest canyon, Valley Marineris.


      WATER

      There
      is strong evidence that the Martian atmospherer was once far denser than it
      is now, and that water once ran freely on its surface. There is also mounting
      evidence that much of this water remains locked away underground.


      MOON

      Mars
      has two small natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos, that orbit very close
      to the planet. These moons may be  captured asterioid. It has been predicted
      that in about 50 milions years, Phobos will either crash into Mars''s surface
      or break up into a ring structure around the planet.


      MISSION

      Mars
      is the focus of intense study, with two rovers(exploration rover Opportunity
      and science laboratory Curiosity) operating on th surface, while three tinternational
      missions orbits the planet: NASA''s Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
      and ESA''s Mars Express.


      OBSERVATION

      Mars can easily be seen
      from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitued
      is surpassed by the Sun, the Moon, Venus and Jupiter - but it can briefly match
      Jupiter''s brightness at certain points in its orbit.'
