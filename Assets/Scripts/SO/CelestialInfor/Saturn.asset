    description: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet
      in the Solar System. Until the invention of modern telescope, Saturn was regarded
      as outermost of the know planets.\n\nMASS\nAlthough the second largest, Saturn
      is the least dese of all the planets in the Solar System, with only one-eighth
      the density of Earth(but nine times its diameter). It is also the only planet
      is less dese than water.\n\nRING\nWhile the other gas giants also have ring
      systems, Saturn's is larger and more visible than any  other in the Solar System.
      The rings are composed of water ice crystals and a smaller amount of rock,
      ragingg in size fromm specks of dust to a few praticles as large as mountains.\n\nOBSERVATION\nSaturn
      appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light.
      Magnifying at least 30 x xresilves Saturn's rings.
