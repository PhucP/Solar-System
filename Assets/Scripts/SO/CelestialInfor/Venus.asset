    description: \nAlthough Venus has very similar size and interior structure as
      Earth, its vulcanic surface and extrmely hot and dese atmosphere makes is one
      of the most inhospitable places in the Solar System.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nThick couds
      of sulfuric acid and dust reflest most of the Sun's light back to space, while
      carbon dioxide traps the Sun's heat inside the atmosphere, causing a runaway
      greenhousr effect. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is 92 times
      greater than Earth.\n\nOBSERVATION\nVenus is one of the brightest objects in
      our night sky - second only to the Moon. It appears as either an evening or
      a morning star.
