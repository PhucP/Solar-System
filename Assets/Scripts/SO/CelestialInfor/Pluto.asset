    description: 'Pluto is the largest object in the Kuiper belt. It is also the
      largest and second most massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System.


      AXIAL
      TILT

      Like Uranus, Pluto is lying on its "side", with an axial titl of
      120 degree, leading to extreme seasonal variations. At its solstices, one-fourth
      of the planet is in continous daylight, and one-fourth in continuous darkness.


      MOONS

      Pluto
      has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, kerberos, and Styx Pluto and Charon
      are sometimes described as a binary system because the barycenter of their
      orbit does not lie within either body.


      DISCOVERY

      Discovered
      in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was originally classified as the
      9th planet from the Sun. However, the discovery of similar-size object within
      the Kupier Beil, promped the International Astronomical Union to re-calssify
      Pluto in 2006 a dwaf planet.'
